### Run `npm install` to install dependenices
		$ npm install

### Run the app!
		$ npm start

### TODO 

1. Running production builds - precompiling webpack into a 'build' folder
2. Production builds should support cache-busting
3. Production builds should support commons chunk and page specific chunks. 
4. Builds should also support asynchronous script loading
